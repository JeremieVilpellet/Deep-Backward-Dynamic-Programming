# Deep backward schemes for high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs

""" All result are based on the article on the repo """

The project implements deep learning methods described in the [research paper](docs/dbdp-research-paper.pdf) by Côme Huré, Huyên Pham, and Xavier Warin, leveraging the classical backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) representation to efficiently approximate high-dimensional nonlinear PDE solutions.

## Structure

[**docs/**](docs/) includes the original research paper.

[**notebooks/**](notebooks/) contains Jupyter notebooks that replicate results from the [research paper](docs/dbdp-research-paper.pdf).

[**models/**](models/) provides pretrained networks and saved model checkpoints.
